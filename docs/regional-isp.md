# International ISPs in the Middle East

An ISP(Internet service providers) is a company that provides individuals and other companies access to the internet.An ISP has the equipment to provide internet to a specific geographic area. The larger ISPs have their own infrastructure so that they are less dependent on the telecommunication providers and can provide better service to their customers. However, there are 3 levels of ISPs. Tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 providers.<br />
Tier 1 providers or backbone provider, exchange Internet traffic with other tier 1 providers via peering , or with other internet providers via transit.Without these providers there wouldn't be traffic exchange between continents.<br />
Tier 2 on the other hand are service providers which connect between tier 1 and tier 3 providers.<br />
Finaly Tier 3 ISP are providers that purchase internet transit and redistribute to their clients.<br />

In this project we are going to analyse the international ISPs(Tier 1 and Tier 2) for the MENOG region.This will be possible with the help of RIPE NCC stat where we can extract
